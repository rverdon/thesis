The Integrated Genome Browser (IGB) aims to meet this need. IGB is an open source, desktop graphical display tool implemented in Java that supports real-time zooming and panning through a genome; layout of genomic features and datasets in moveable, adjustable tiers; incremental or genome-scale data loading from remote web servers or local files; and dynamic manipulation of quantitative data via genome graphs.Availability: The application and source code are available from http://igb.bioviz.org and http://genoviz.sourceforge.net.Contact: aloraine@uncc.edu},

	abstract = {Motivation: Internet-based electronic resources, as given by Uniform Resource Locators {(URLs)}, are being increasingly used in scientific publications but are also becoming inaccessible in a time-dependant manner, a phenomenon documented across disciplines. Initial reports brought attention to the problem, spawning methods of effectively preserving {URL} content while some journals adopted policies regarding {URL} publication and begun storing supplementary information on journal websites. Thus, a reexamination of {URL} growth and decay in the literature is merited to see if the problem has grown or been mitigated by any of these {changes.Results:} After the 2003 study, three follow-up studies were conducted in 2004, 2005 and 2007. Unfortunately, no significant change was found in the rate of {URL} decay among any of the studies. However, only 5\% of {URLs} cited more than twice have decayed versus 20\% of {URLs} cited once or twice. The most common types of lost content were computer programs (43\%), followed by scholarly content (38\%) and databases (19\%). Compared to {URLs} still available, no lost content type was significantly over- or underrepresented. Searching for 30 of these websites using Google, 11 (37\%) were found relocated to different {URLs.Conclusions:} {URL} decay continues unabated, but {URLs} published by organizations tend to be more stable. Repeated citation of {URLs} suggests calculation of an electronic impact factor {(eIF)} would be an objective, quantitative way to measure the impact of Internet-based resources on scientific {research.Contact:} {Jonathan-Wren@OMRF.org}},

	abstract = {Motivation: Next-generation {DNA} sequencing machines are generating an enormous amount of sequence data, placing unprecedented demands on traditional single-processor read-mapping algorithms. {CloudBurst} is a new parallel read-mapping algorithm optimized for mapping next-generation sequence data to the human genome and other reference genomes, for use in a variety of biological analyses including {SNP} discovery, genotyping and personal genomics. It is modeled after the short read-mapping program {RMAP}, and reports either all alignments or the unambiguous best alignment for each read with any number of mismatches or differences. This level of sensitivity could be prohibitively time consuming, but {CloudBurst} uses the open-source Hadoop implementation of {MapReduce} to parallelize execution using multiple compute {nodes.Results:} {CloudBurst's} running time scales linearly with the number of reads mapped, and with near linear speedup as the number of processors increases. In a 24-processor core configuration, {CloudBurst} is up to 30 times faster than {RMAP} executing on a single core, while computing an identical set of alignments. Using a larger remote compute cloud with 96 cores, {CloudBurst} improved performance by {\textgreater}100-fold, reducing the running time from hours to mere minutes for typical jobs involving mapping of millions of short reads to the human {genome.Availability:} {CloudBurst} is available open-source as a model for parallelizing algorithms with {MapReduce} at {http://cloudburst-bio.sourceforge.net/.Contact:} mschatz@umiacs.umd.edu},
